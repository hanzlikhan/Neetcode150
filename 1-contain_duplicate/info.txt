Nice pick! The **"Contains Duplicate"** problem is a classic beginner LeetCode question, great for understanding problem-solving approaches.

---

### üîç Problem Recap:
You‚Äôre given a list of integers, and you need to check:
- If **any number appears more than once**, return `True`.
- If **all numbers are unique**, return `False`.

---

### ‚úÖ Input/Output
```python
Input:  nums = [1, 2, 3, 3]
Output: True

Input:  nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: False
```

---

## ‚úÖ APPROACHES TO SOLVE THIS

### ‚úÖ 1. **Brute Force** (Beginner-friendly but not efficient)

**Idea:** Compare every element with every other element.

```python
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == nums[j]:
                return True
    return False
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n¬≤)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)  
‚úÖ Easy to write, but slow for large arrays.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Using a Set (Optimal and Pythonic)**

**Idea:** Use a `set` to track seen numbers. If you see a number again, return `True`.

```python
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    seen = set()
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(n)  
‚úÖ Efficient and clean. This is the most common real-world solution.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Using Sorting**

**Idea:** Sort the array. If there are duplicates, they will be next to each other.

```python
def containsDuplicate(nums):
    nums.sort()
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            return True
    return False
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) or O(n) depending on the sort  
‚úÖ Works fine, but not as fast as the set method.

### üß† TL;DR Which to Use?

| Approach       | Time      | Space     | When to use |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Brute Force    | O(n¬≤)     | O(1)      | For learning, not practice |
| Set            | O(n)      | O(n)      | ‚úÖ Best overall |
| Sorting        | O(n log n)| O(1)      | If space is tight |

Now, let me know:
- Do you want to start implementing one of these from scratch?
- Or do you want me to explain how sets work, or how to code part of this?
